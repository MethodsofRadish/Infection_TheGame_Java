# Infection_TheGame_Java
Creating the Infection Bacterial Game previous attempted in Python, but now in Java!

This is more a reflection of my abilities in terms of creating and generating classes that can be built, accessed and utilized in Main. Following the logic of a fun, interactive game. Based on text provided by the user. 

The current iteration will not be as advanced and interactive as the Python version, but it should still be fun. Also cool to see the code.
